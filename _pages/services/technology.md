We offer services on data management systems and portal development, setup and installation, authoring of data collection forms for use in data entry and data collection platforms, data analysis scripts and workflow development and deployment, and development of web-based tools and applications.

We support open-source technologies. Hence, we create, build upon and use open-source technologies. We believe open-source is good all around and ultimately the best for the end-user.


## Data Analysis

![image-left](/assets/images/RlogoSmall.png){: .align-left}
R is an environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It is called a software “environment” to characterise it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

RAnalyticFlow is a software that enables simple to complex data analysis through the drawing of analysis flowcharts. The key advantage of the use of analysis flowcharts is the effective sharing of the data analysis processes in multi-user or multi-developer or team collaboration contexts. RAnalyticFlow is one of a number of integrated / interactive development environment (IDE) for R. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. The RAnalyticFlow software is developed and made available without charge for any purpose by ef-prime, Inc.

## Data collection and management

EpiData Entry is designed for simple or programmed data entry and documentation. EpiData Entry handles simple forms or related systems with optimised documentation and error detection features such as double entry verification, codebook overview of data, and encryption procedures to name a few. The EpiData software suite was designed based on the principles of Epi Info version 6 and has developed into an independent documentation-oriented system. EpiData is currently developed for Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP.

The Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) is a public domain software package used by hundreds of organizations and tens of thousands of individuals for entering, editing, tabulating, and disseminating census and survey data. CSPro is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, yet powerful enough to handle the most complex applications. It can be used by a wide range of people, from non-technical staff assistants to senior demographers and programmers.

CSPro supports data collection on android devices (phones and tablets). The CSEntry Android App works in collaboration with the desktop version of CSPro 6.2. CSEntry collects data for surveys created by the free Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) suite of data processing tools. CSEntry is used for computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) on Android phones and tablets.

Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to 1) build a data collection form or survey (XLSForm is recommended for larger forms); 2) collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and 3) aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

Telerivet is an innovative mobile messaging platform that instantly connects businesses and organizations with their customers, employees, and community. No servers, programmers, expensive contracts, or shortcodes required. Telerivet uses a tool that most people in any country already have – a standard mobile phone. A cloud-based management system routes messages to and from any number of mobile devices, allowing you to reach anyone who has a mobile phone with SMS.

## Tools
In support of spatial sampling methods, Valid International creates web-based interactive sampling tools. These tools are useful for assessments done at scale (regional to national level).

Recently, Valid International has supported Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) in developing a spatial sampling tool that will assist them in their planned urban water and sanitation surveys in Dhaka in Bangladesh, Antananarivo in Madagascar, Nakuru in Kenya, Accra in Ghana and Maputo in Mozambique.
