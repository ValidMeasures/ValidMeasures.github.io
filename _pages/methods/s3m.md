[Simple Spatial Sampling Method](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/metrics/s3m/) or S3M is a development of CSAS for very wide area usage including national level surveys. The key features of S3M

- Sampling points using a triangular irregular network (TIN) rather than a grid
- Highly efficient use of data (c. 6 × reuse of data)
- Lower cost than CSAS (10 x area for 2 × cost)
- Maps a 'coverage surface'
- Automatic smoothing of data
- Simple to understand

<br/>

## Design
S3M uses a two-stage sampling design. The first stage is a systematic spatial sample using a triangular irregular network rather than a grid to identify communities to sample. The second stage is active and adaptive case-finding as with the other coverage survey methods.

<br/>

## Results
S3M provides the following outputs:

- Coverage map similar to that of CSAS
- Overall estimate of coverage
- Ranked list of barriers to access
