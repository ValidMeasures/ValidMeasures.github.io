    excerpt: "R is an environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It is called a software environment to characterise it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS."

Our ***[Technology](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/technology/)*** module answers the questions on what tools to use for data collection and measurement, management and analysis, and on what data systems and frameworks to adopt to support and sustain organisation data use.

We offer services on data management systems and portal development, setup and installation, authoring of data collection forms for use in data entry and data collection platforms, data analysis scripts and workflow development and deployment, and development of web-based tools and applications.

We support open-source technologies. Hence, we create, build upon and use open-source technologies. We believe open-source is good all around and ultimately the best for the end-user.
