    excerpt: "Centric Systematic Area Sampling or CSAS was developed in 2002 and was initially used to test and reform the community-based therapeutic care or CTC model of service delivery, later referred to as community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) or integrated management of acute malnutrition (IMAM)."

    title: SQUEAC
    excerpt: "Semi-quantitative evaluation of access and coverage (SQUEAC) is a method that provides an in-depth analysis of barriers and boosters to coverage. It is designed for use as a regular service monitoring tool through the intelligent use of routine monitoring data complemented by other relevant data that are collected on a ‘little and often’ basis."

    title: SLEAC
    excerpt: "Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage or SLEAC is a rapid low-resource survey method that classifies coverage at the service delivery unit (SDU) level. The advantage of this approach is that relatively small sample sizes are required."

Our ***[Metrics](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/metrics/)*** module provides solutions to questions on ***what indicators to measure*** and ***how they can be measured***. We offer services on ***indicators development***, ***assessment design*** and ***assessment implementation***.

These services leverage Valid International's experience and expertise drawn from a long history of innovation that includes the development of indicators and methods for the assessment of coverage of community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM), highly-scalable spatial survey methods that can be used to measure and map multiple indicators and assessment methods that utilise small sample sizes and can be implemented rapidly and repeatedly over time across a wide range of indicators.<br/><br/>

## CMAM coverage
Valid International is a pioneer in the development of coverage assessment metrics and methods for CMAM. Increasing numbers of organisations have used these metrics and methods to assess the coverage of selective feeding programmes they implement or support.
