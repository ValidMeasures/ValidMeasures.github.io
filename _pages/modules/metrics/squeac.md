[Semi-quantitative evaluation of access and coverage (SQUEAC)](https://validmeasures.org/modules/metrics/squeac/) is a method that provides an in-depth analysis of barriers and boosters to coverage. It is designed for use as a regular service monitoring tool through the intelligent use of routine monitoring data complemented by other relevant data that are collected on a “little and often” basis.

<br/>

## Design
SQUEAC is more an investigation than a survey. SQUEAC is made up of three stages:

**Stage 1:** Semi-quantitative investigation into factors affecting coverage. This is carried out using the SQUEAC toolkit, which is a set of simple and rapid tools and methods for collecting and analysing data related to coverage. Stage 1 will typically identify barriers to coverage and investigate the spatial pattern of coverage. Stage 1 alone is capable of providing a great deal of information about coverage that may be used to reform the service.

**Stage 2:** Confirm areas of high and low coverage and other hypotheses relating to coverage identified in stage 1 through small studies, small surveys, and small-area surveys.

**Stage 3:** Estimate overall coverage using Bayesian techniques. A likelihood survey is conducted as part of this stage. This survey utilises a two-stage sampling design. The first stage is a systematic spatial sample. The second stage is an active and adaptive case-finding. This two-stage sampling design is the same as with all other coverage survey methods described in this document. Stage 3 is optional and is done if the reporting of an overall coverage estimate is a key information requirement in addition to the rich information on barriers and boosters to coverage already gained from stages 1 and 2.

<br/>

## Results
SQUEAC provides the following results:

- Concept map of barriers and boosters to coverage
- Coverage map using small area surveys through a “risk mapping” approach
- Estimation of coverage proportion using Bayesian techniques
