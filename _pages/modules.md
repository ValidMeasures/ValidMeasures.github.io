We offer modules on [metrics](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/metrics), [analytics](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/analytics), [technology](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/technology) and [training](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/training) for assessments which have been designed to support organisations to setup and implement, analyse and report, and manage and sustain assessments needed for them to run highly-effective programmes.

The modules offered can be utilised individually or as linked modules depending on your organisation's specific needs. Under each module are various technical services and products that we provide. Our ***services*** are generic and can be developed and applied bespoke to an organisation's assessment needs and requirements. Our ***products***, on the other hand, are specialised and specific services that we have previously designed, developed and tested. The products are ready for use 'off-the-shelf' therefore rapid to setup, implement and scale up.

{% include feature_row %}

Whilst our services and products can be utilised individually, we recommend ***Support Packages*** - a combination of our [metrics](https://validmeasures.github.io/metrics), analytics, technology and training modules - that have been synergised to optimise client support and to make the support more cost-effective. As with the modules, our support packages can be classified as ***’off-the-shelf’*** or as ***’developmental’***.
