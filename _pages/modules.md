We offer modules on [metrics](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/metrics), [analytics](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/analytics), [technology](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/technology) and [training](https://validmeasures.github.io/modules/training) for assessments which have been designed to support organisations to setup and implement, analyse and report, and manage and sustain assessments needed for them to run highly-effective programmes.<br/><br/>

The modules offered can be utilised individually or as linked modules depending on your organisation's specific needs. Under each module are various technical services and products that we provide. Our ***services*** are generic and can be developed and applied bespoke to an organisation's assessment needs and requirements. Our ***products***, on the other hand, are specialised and specific services that we have previously designed, developed and tested. The products are ready for use 'off-the-shelf' therefore rapid to setup, implement and scale up.<br/><br/>
