We at [Valid International](http://www.validinternational.org) believe that there is a better way for organisations to approach assessments. With the appropriate metrics to measure the problem or issues in question, robust analytics to estimate the value of the indicators being measured, the right technology – simple to use tools that aid in making assessments rapid and efficient, and an effective training that is based on a learner-oriented and problem-based learning system, organisations can take control of their assessment needs and goals.

We offer modules on metrics, analytics, technology and training for assessments which have been designed to support organisations to setup and implement, analyse and report, and manage and sustain assessments needed for them to run highly-effective programmes.

The modules offered can be utilised individually or as linked modules depending on your organisation's specific needs. Under each module are various technical services and products that we provide. Our services are generic and can be developed and applied bespoke to an organisation's assessment needs and requirements. Our products, on the other hand, are specialised and specific services that we have previously designed, developed and tested. The products are ready for use 'off-the-shelf' therefore rapid to setup, implement and scale up.

Whilst our services and products can be utilised individually, we recommend ***Support Packages*** - a combination of our [metrics](https://validmeasures.github.io/metrics), analytics, technology and training modules - that have been synergised to optimise client support and to make the support more cost-effective. As with the modules, our support packages can be classified as ***’off-the-shelf’*** or as ***’developmental’***.
