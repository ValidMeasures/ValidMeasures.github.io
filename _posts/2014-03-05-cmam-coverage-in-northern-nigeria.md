A coverage survey using the Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage or SLEAC methodology was carried out across 71 Local Government Areas (LGAs) implementing CMAM program in 11 states in the north of Nigeria. The SLEAC used a two-standards, three-class classifier with 20% and 50% as the thresholds to determine low, moderate and high coverage classes (i.e. 20% or less, between 20% and 50% and greater than 50% respectively).

Of the 71 LGAs surveyed, more than half have moderate coverage (40 LGAs) but only 4 have high coverage. There are 27 LGAs with low coverage. At the state level, 8 of the 11 states surveyed have moderate coverage and only 3 states with low coverage. However, no state has achieved high coverage. Except for Adamawa and Kebbi state, coverage in all other states is heterogeneous. Overall, coverage in the northern states of Nigeria is moderate with an overall estimate of 36.6% (95% CI: 32.3% – 40.9% ).

The key barriers to service uptake and access for those children who were not in the program are: 1) ignorance of malnutrition; 2) no knowledge of the program; 3) ignorance of how the program works; 4) constraints and responsibility of the mother; 5) service delivery problems; and 5) geographical access issues.

Based on the levels of coverage achieved and the barriers identified, the following actions are recommended to improve coverage:

   1. Strengthening of the program’s community mobilization strategy with a strong emphasis on raising community awareness regarding malnutrition, its causes and manifestations and available treatment through the program. Community mobilization should be aimed at the whole community including community leaders;

   2. Strengthening the integration of CMAM into the activities of the health center (e.g. EPI, consultations, etc.);

   3. Develop, trial and institutionalize alternative service delivery mechanisms that aim to increase beneficiaries’ access to the program’s services with particular attention to those who live far from health centers or health posts providing the service. These alternative mechanisms may include mobile treatment centers that would cater for most distant villages or fortnightly follow-ups for beneficiaries who live far from treatment sites or who face significant opportunity costs related to the standard weekly follow-up visits;

   4. Setting up the management of moderate acute malnutrition component of CMAM; and,

   5. Perform a focused SQUEAC in a selection of the LGAs implementing CMAM which builds on the findings of the SLEAC particularly with regard to the spatial distribution of coverage in each of the LGA and within the states. This would entail more detailed mapping of the results of the SLEAC that would inform how improvements to the program can be implemented particularly in terms of positioning of new treatment sites (if deemed necessary) or alternative service delivery mechanisms mentioned in item 3 above.


## Introduction
In Nigeria, acute malnutrition of children under 5 years is a major public health concern. Nigeria is ranked third in the world for absolute number of children under 5 years with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) particularly in the country’s northern states where the risk of acute malnutrition is highest[^1].

In response to this situation, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) supported by partners has been implementing community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program with the aim of treating children afflicted by the condition and hence preventing mortality caused by malnutrition. CMAM implementation was first piloted in 2009 in 3 LGAs of Gombe state and 5 LGAs of Kebbi state. By 2010 the CMAM program was expanded to other states namely Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi, Adamawa, Yobe and Borno with a total of 378 CMAM sites[^2]

Programme coverage, defined as the proportion of children 6 to 59 months old with SAM who receive therapeutic care, is a key indicator of CMAM program impact. Measuring program coverage is therefore a critical step in assessing program performance. It is for this purpose that a SLEAC has been performed in the 11 states across 71 LGAs in the north of the country that are implementing CMAM.

This report describes and details the process and the outcomes of the SLEAC conducted.


## Objectives
The objectives of the SLEAC survey are:

  * To assess the impact of the CMAM program in 75 LGAs across  11 states (i.e.  Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara) in the north of Nigeria;

  * To train in-country survey team on the SLEAC; and,

  * To raise awarenss and understanding on program coverage and build capacity of partners involved at different levels (Ministries, NGOs, UNICEF)


## Methodology

### SLEAC sample design
SLEAC was used as a wide-area survey method in order to classify coverage at the Local government Area (LGA) level.

SLEAC is a low-resource method for classifying and estimating the coverage of selective feeding programs. SLEAC surveys classify coverage at the level of the service delivery unit. It provides also limited data (i.e., reasons for non-attendance collected from a single informant type using a single method with a small sample size) on barriers to service uptake and analysis. This varies with the scale of the program.

SLEAC survey uses a two-stage sampling design.


#### Stage 1 sampling: Selection of PSUs
This is the sampling method that is used to select the villages or settlements to be sampled in the survey. The primary sampling unit (PSU) used in the SLEAC survey was village or settlement. Complete village lists per LGA organized by ward were provided by the National Bureau of Statistic (NBS). The structure of LGA-level samples are shown in [Figure 1](#FIG1).

<a name="FIG1"></a>
**Figure 1:** Structure of samples in LGAs
<iframe width="800" height="200" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless src="http://www.validmeasures.org/charts/sleac-sample-structure.html"></iframe>

A target of \\( n = 40 \\) cases was used in each LGA. This is a standard SLEAC sample size for large populations.

The number of PSUs needed to reach the target sample size in each LGA was calculated using the following formula:

$$ n_{psu}=\frac{\text{Target sample size (n)}}{\text{median village population all ages}\times{\frac{\text{percentage of population 6 - 59 months}}{100}}\times{\frac{\text{SAM prevalence}}{100}}} $$

The percentage of the population aged between 6 and 59 months was estimated as 18%. SAM prevalence rates by MUAC were taken from results of SMART surveys conducted in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The SAM prevalence rate used in the formula for each state was adjusted from the results of the prevalence surveys taking into account the difference in seasons between the dates that the prevalence surveys were conducted and the dates that the SLEACs were going to be performed. More importantly,  adjustments were made to the SAM prevalence rates with the underlying aim of ensuring that enough villages or settlements were surveyed in order to reach the target sample size of 40 per LGA. This generally meant having to underestimate the prevalence of SAM per state. [Table 1](#TAB1) presents the SAM prevalence rates per state used to obtain the number of LGAs to be surveyed using the formula specified above.

<a name="TAB1"></a>
**Table 1:** SAM prevalence rates per state used in the SLEAC survey
<iframe width="800" height="250" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless src="http://www.validmeasures.org/charts/sam-prevalence-rates.html"></iframe>

It should be noted that the SAM prevalence rates used were state level estimates and not LGA prevalence results. The recommendation for SLEAC surveys is that wherever possible, local prevalence rates (i.e. rates estimated for the local areas in which the SLEAC survey is being conducted) should be used. For the case of this SLEAC, there were no SMART surveys done at the LGA level. Hence, we assumed that SAM prevalence is homogenous within each state and assigned the SAM prevalence of the state to each of the constituent LGAs to be surveyed.

A minimum of 25 PSUs was set in cases were the calculated number of villages / settlements per LGA needed to be sampled was less than 25. This was done to ensure as much as possible an even spatial spread of the stage 1 sample.

A systematic sampling approach was used to select the PSUs to be sampled. This was done through the following steps:

**Step 1.** The list of villages was organized by LGA and then by ward.

**Step 2.** A sampling interval was calculated using the following formula:

\\[ \text{sampling interval}=\frac{\text{number of villages in LGA}}{n_{psu}} \\]

**Step 3.** A random starting PSU from the top of the list was selected using a random number between 1 and the sampling interval. The random number was generated using Microsoft Excel® software.

**Stage 2.** A within-community sampling method
Stage 2 sampling involves finding the target population in the selected PSUs. The target population was:

  * Child aged 6 to 59 months old; and,
    
  * MUAC < 115 mm; and / or,

  * With nutritional oedema; and / or

  * In the CMAM program

The PSUs selected in stage 1 were sampled using a case-finding method designed to find all or nearly all SAM cases in the particular PSU.

In rural PSUs, an active and adaptive case finding approach was used. This method involved developing a case-finding question appropriate to the location and context from the base question of:

*Where can we find children who are sick, thin, have swollen legs or feet, or have recently been sick and have not recovered fully, or are attending a feeding program?*

This question was adapted and improved using information collected from key informants to include local terms (in all local languages) and local aetiological beliefs regarding wasting and oedema.

In urban PSUs, house-to-house, door-to-door case finding was implemented. This is based on experience in conducting coverage surveys in urban areas where the use of key informants and context-specific case finding questions was not effective in finding all SAM cases.

Once found, SAM cases were then assessed as to whether they were covered in the CMAM program or not.

  * A SAM case was assessed to be covered by the program if the child meets the criteria of the target population stated above and is enrolled in the program verified by the presence of RUTF or the OTP card
  
  * A SAM case was assessed to be not covered by the program if the child meets the criteria of the target population and is not enrolled in the program.

  * A recovering case is a child aged 6 – 59 months who is enrolled in the program and waiting to be discharged with a MUAC > 115 mm and no nutritional oedema.

A tally sheet was filled for each village sampled and each child who fulfilled the criteria of the survey was recorded. When a SAM case was not covered a standard questionnaire regarding the barriers to access and coverage was administered to the caregiver.


### Coverage Estimator
There are two coverage estimators that have been developed: point and period coverage.

**Point coverage**
This estimator uses data for current cases (i.e. those children who are still currently SAM) only. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$ \text{point coverage}=\frac{\text{number of current cases attending program}}{\text{number of current cases}} $$

The point coverage estimator provides a snapshot of program performance and places a strong emphasis on the coverage and timeliness of case-finding and recruitment.

**Period coverage**
This estimator uses data for both current and recovering cases. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$ \text{period coverage}=\frac{\text{number of current and recovering cases in the program}}{\text{number of current and recovering cases}} $$

The period coverage estimator includes recovering cases. These are children that should be in the program because they have not yet met program discharge criteria.

Depending on program context, either point or period coverage should be used to describe program coverage. In general, the recommendation is that if the program has good case-finding and short lengths of stay, period coverage is likely to be appropriate. On the other hand, if the program has poor case-finding and recruitment and long lengths of stay due to late presentation and / or late admission, point coverage is likely to be appropriate.

In the case of this SLEAC, it would have been ideal that an appropriate, LGA-specific coverage estimator be chosen to best capture the coverage situation in each LGA. However, there was limited program information and context available to the survey team to fully decide which estimator to use per LGA.

Despite this limitation, there are general characteristics of CMAM programming in Nigeria and the coverage achievements of some LGAs where surveys have been conducted before that provide insight and guidance as to which coverage estimator is most appropriate albeit for all the LGAs surveyed and not LGA-specific.

In general, the following observations about CMAM programming and coverage in Nigeria can be made:

  * CMAM programming in Nigeria is challenging mainly due to the high caseloads and the geographical spread of the need for the services. This manifests as large numbers of cases coming in for the first time or for follow-up. In such context, case-finding for enrolment to the program is always a difficult task.
  
  * Defaulting is a significant issue in Nigeria. Whilst some of the programs implemented in  particular states and LGAs (especially those in which previous coverage surveys has already noted this problem and have provided recommendations for improvement) may have improved on this problem already but for majority of the LGAs surveyed this is most likely still a significant problem.

Given these observations and based on knowledge of previous coverage surveys done in Nigeria, point coverage was chosen as the more appropriate coverage estimator for reporting coverage estimates for the following reasons:

  * Timely case-finding will always be an important factor to achieving good coverage and in the context of CMAM programming in Nigeria this factor is also the hardest to get right. Using the point coverage estimator will further emphasise the importance of timely case-finding towards increasing program coverage. As will be noted later in the report, it is very likely that the LGAs with moderate to high point coverage are more likely to have good and timely case-finding.

  * Point coverage will most likely have less bias than period coverage in the context of high defaulting. A recent study into defaulting in Gombe state showed that whilst death was shown as the main outcome of those who have defaulted, recovery (i.e. MUAC > 115 and no oedema) was the third most common outcome after defaulting. Period coverage doesn’t take into account cases who are recovering but are not in the program (such as those defaulters who have recovered) and as such tend to overestimate coverage. Point coverage, on the other hand, is not susceptible to this bias as it doesn’t account for recovering cases. Whilst this may not be the case for some LGAs with no problems with defaulting, it is very likely that for most LGAs that face the complex mechanism of defaulting, period coverage may give a distorted assessment of coverage.


### Data analysis
#### Coverage classification
The simplified lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) classification technique was used to analyse the data. A two-standard (20% and 50%), three-class (low, moderate, high) classifier was used to classify the coverage in each LGA. The three classes were defined as follows:

  * <strong>Low coverage:</strong> 20% or below
  
  * <strong>Moderate coverage:</strong> greater than 20% and up to 50%

  * <strong>High coverage:</strong> greater than 50%

<a name="FIG2"></a>
**Figure 2:** Two-standard, three-tier classifier
![](/assets/images/sleacClassifier.png/)

The standards were used to create decision rules using the rule-of-thumb formulas:

$$ \begin{align*}
d_{1} &= \lfloor \  {n \times p_{1}} \  \rfloor = \left \lfloor \ n \times \frac {20}{100} \ \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor \ \frac {n}{5} \ \right \rfloor \\[0.5cm]
d_{2} &= \lfloor \  {n \times p_{2}} \  \rfloor = \left \lfloor \ n \times \frac {50}{100} \ \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor \ \frac {n}{2} \ \right \rfloor \\[0.5cm]
&\text {where} \\[0.5cm]
n &= \text{sample size achieved by the survey} \\
p_{1} &= \text{lower coverage threshold} \\
p_{2} &= \text{upper coverage threshold}
\end{align*}$$

Coverage in each LGA and state was classified using the algorithm presented in [Figure 3](#FIG3).

#### Coverage estimation
An aggregate estimate of coverage was calculated for each state and for all the LGAs combined using standard weighted estimation of proportions techniques used for a stratified sample as described in the FANTA SQUEAC and SLEAC Technical Reference. Chi-square testing was performed to assess whether coverage results were homogeneous within each state. Whether or not coverage is homogenous within each state allows for the contextualisation of the state level and overall coverage estimates calculated[^3].

### Survey implementation
The SLEAC coverage survey was carried out in two blocks:

  * West block: Kebbi, Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara and Kano States

  * East block: Gombe, Bauchi, Jigawa, Yobe, Borno and Adamawa States

Due to security reasons, it was not possible to perform the survey in 4 Bama, Ngala, Mobbar and Monguno LGAs of Borno State hence survey was cancelled in these LGAs.

The SLEAC survey in the West Block was held from 1 October 2013 to 20 December 2013 and in the East Block from 9 December 2013 to 19 February 2014.

#### Training of interviewers
Two training sessions on the SLEAC methodology (4 days for each training) were conducted for each of the two groups of investigators from two blocks. One was held in the Kebbi State from 2 to 6 October 2013 and another in Gombe State from 9 December to 12 December 2013. In the spirit of capacity building, 8 managers from NBS, one manager from the MOH and 15 surveyors from NBS and MOH  belonging to the West Block survey team were trained. For the East Block, 8 managers from NBS, one from the MOH and 20 surveyors (11 from MOH and 9 from NBS) were also trained.

The theoretical component of the training covered an introduction to coverage, the objectives of the SLEAC survey, SLEAC methodology, the procedure for active adaptive case-finding method, anthropometric measurement and tools of the survey. Practice focused on anthropometric measurements (the standardization of anthropometric measurements), research local terminology used to describe malnutrition, and active case finding.

#### Sampling
Only LGAs with CMAM program were surveyed. [Table 2](#TAB2) shows the number and proportion of LGAs of different states which had CMAM programs hence surveyed.

On the list of villages covered by the CMAM program provided by NBS, some villages sampled were replaced by others during the implementation of the survey. The reasons for replacement were 1) sampled settlement/village was not included in the LGA covered by CMAM program; 2) the village was uninhabited or was no longer there;  3) population has migrated; and, 4) in some villages (Njibiri and Wafi in Borno, Jaji gurawa in Yobe state) surveyors were rejected because population thought survey was about EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) program of polio; and, 5) due to insecurity. The new village chosen was selected for its proximity to the old village.

#### Data collection
Data collection was carried out for the Western Block by 15 investigators (7 from NBS and 8 from MOH) who were grouped into 6 teams and data collection of the states of Eastern block was carried out by 20 investigators (NBS 11 and 9 MOH) who were grouped into 10  two-person teams.

During the investigation, supervision of activities was provided by [Valid International](http://www.validinternational.org) consultants. After completing the survey in a state a debriefing session was organized to provide instant results of the state to the authorities of MOH, NBS and other partners involved in the CMAM activities.


#### Quality control of data
To ensure data quality, the following measures were put in place:

  * Regular field supervision of surveyors in each state except for Yobe and Borno due to insecurity;

  * Random field data checks were performed by supervisors to confirm case finding and also recording of data on tally sheets; and,

  * In the state of Yobe where supervisors were not able to go due to insecurity, some LGAs like Geidam, Nguru and Potaskum were done two times  by different teams of surveyors to confirm the result found.


#### Difficulties encountered during the survey

  * Some villages were inaccessible by vehicles due to lack of roads and in some situations investigators were obliged to walk to reach the villages or used motorcycles, canoes or walk on foot to cross a river to reach the village. Some roads were too sandy;
  
  * Administrative procedures with local authorities before starting the survey in a state and LGAs were cumbersome which contributed to the slowness in the implementation of the activities of the investigation;

  * The scheduled dates of debriefing in some states did not suit or fit in very well with the agenda of local authorities and in some situations, the SLEAC survey team was obliged to go back from one state to the previous state in order to perform a debriefing session and this situation slowed down the activities of the survey; and,
  
  * Insecurity in some states especially Yobe and Borno states. Two investigators withdrew from the survey because of the insecurity in these two states. Due to insecurity, 4 LGAs in Borno State, namely Bama, Ngala, Monguno, Mobbar, were not surveyed and some villages were replaced.


## Results


### Profiles of SAM children
We profiled the SAM cases found during the survey by their age and their MUAC. The median age was for all cases found in the survey and the median MUAC was for all the uncovered cases because it gives us information about the risk of mortality of SAM not covered in the community. [Table 4](#TAB4) summarises the  characteristics of age of all cases of the survey and MUAC of uncovered cases found.

This age profile indicates that the sample of SAM cases found during the coverage survey was what expected. SAM was expected to be more prevalent in the younger age group of children between 6 to 24 months, as they are the most susceptible to various known causal factors of malnutrition.

Regarding the MUAC, except for Kano, Gombe, Jigawa and Yobe states, the medians of uncovered cases found of others states are less than 110 mm indicating a high risk of mortality. This gives information about time of the SAM cases spent in the community without being identified by active case finding of volunteers. As the median was less than 110 mm, (not close to 115 mm)  these showed that SAM cases have spent more time in community without being detected by volunteers, therefore in recommendation much effort should be done to catch  SAM cases very early and to recruit them into  the program for these states.

Furthermore it should be noted that of the total of 5947 cases of severe acute malnutrition, 237 cases had oedema or 4.5%. [Table 5](#TAB5) presents the number of oedema cases found for each state and their degree.

#### Coverage classification at the LGA level
[Table 7](#TAB7) presents classification of coverage for each LGA surveyed.

Of the  71 LGAs surveyed, more than half (40 LGAs) have moderate coverage and 27 have low coverage. Only 4 LGAs have high coverage. All LGAs in Kebbi and Sokoto had low coverage. All LGAs in Adamawa have moderate coverage and in Katsina and Kano, all LGAs have moderate coverage except for one for each state which has high coverage. The coverage classification per LGA gives an indication of the homogeneity of coverage results in each of the states. Adamawa, Kebbi and Sokoto whose LGAs all have the same coverage classification most likely have quite even distribution of coverage with Adamawa having an even moderate coverage while Kebbi and Sokoto with an even low coverage. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of the aggregated classification presented above in [Table 6](#TAB6).

[Figure 4](#FIG4) presents a map of point coverage classification for the 71 LGAs surveyed. [Figure 5](#FIG5) presents a map of period coverage classification for the 71 LGAs surveyed.

Chi-square test performed per state indicate that only Adamawa and Kebbi state had homogeneous coverage across the LGA surveyed[^5]. This means that the overall estimates for these two states (12.6% and 48% for Kebbi and Adamawa respectively) most likely is the coverage across all the LGAs providing CMAM services in the two states. For the rest of the states, however, the overall estimates should be taken into context given within-state variability of coverage as shown by the per LGA classification in the previous section and the chi-square testing performed.

The overall point coverage for all states is 36.6 % (32.3 – 40.9%). Again, this result should be taken in context of high variability of coverage across the LGAs.


### Barriers to service uptake and access
A questionnaire was administrated to mothers of SAM cases children who were not in program, in order to identify the barriers of the program. To have a good answer to question, the terminologies of malnutrition in local language were used by surveyors to facilitate understanding of the questions to the mothers.


#### Overall barriers to service and access for the 11 states
The Pareto chart in [Figure 6](#FIG6) shows the overall barriers for the program of all states.

<a name="FIG6"></a>
**Figure 6:** Overall barriers
<iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless src="http://www.validmeasures.org/charts/nigeriaBarriersPareto.html"></iframe>

**Discussion on overall barriers found**
The results of the survey showed that the two main barriers of the program in 11 states are maternal ignorance of malnutrition and lack of knowledge of CMAM program. These two causes remain the two main barriers to coverage of the program as shown in the other programs in other countries[^6].

Regarding ignorance of malnutrition, the majority of mothers did not know that their children were having severe acute malnutrition despite the use of local terminology in asking  questions, they were thinking that it was their normal stature. Thus if a mother does not know that her child was malnourished it was not possible for them to bring her to the program for treatment. This situation calls for an awareness of malnutrition should be carried out in all states.

Ignorance of CMAM program and ignorance of how the program works come respectively in second and third position. Regarding knowledge about the program, the CMAM program in Nigeria is integrated into the activities of the primary health center and not as an emergency activity. Hence according to the fact that we found ignorance of the program like a barriers, raising awareness about the program should also be strengthen. Concerning the barriers about ignorance how the program works, the major barriers were misconceptions concerning the program and the fear of being rejected by the program.

In misconceptions of program, belief in traditional medicine comes first and the fear of being hospitalized in second. These two major barriers on misconceptions of the program and the fear of being rejected calls an important part of sensitization about the program in community, should focus on how the program works. The following barriers are related to constraints by mother. In the community, the mother is often the key person who is responsible for bringing the child into the program and all barriers in general are focused on her. Thus, these barriers regarding constraints and responsibility of the mother in society include the following impediments due to maternal health and also impediments related to the cultural position. In this section also, the refusal of Husband was a major barrier to the coverage due to the cultural position of the mother.

Regarding health service, stock out of RUTF was a major cause of barrier to coverage because without input, a CMAM program cannot operate. Other barriers related to health service as shown in the table are inappropriate treatment (lack of RUTF), attitudes and negative attitudes or inappropriate advice of health workers. Regarding geographical accessibility, distance and transportation problems were significant barriers and just four people have mentioned the problem of insecurity, this was because surveyors went only to places which were safe.


#### Coverage barriers for each state
The summaries of barriers to the program of different states are represented in the Figure 6 to 16. SQUEAC investigations which are going to be carried out in these state will provide detailed explanation of these barriers.


## Conclusions
The coverage in the northern states of Nigeria is moderate with an overall estimate of 36.6% (95% CI: 32.3% – 40.9% ).

Coverage classification was performed for each LGA, in which we have found 27 LGAs having low coverage, 40 LGAs with moderate coverage and 4 LGAs with high coverage. Barriers to coverage have been reported for each state. The survey coverage has allowed under capacity building, to train agents of MOH and NBS on the SLEAC methodology.


## Recommendations
According to overall barriers found by SLEAC coverage survey, some preliminary recommendations have been formulated which can be applied to all programs of each state:


### Emphasis on community mobilisation


#### Sensitization
Awareness through voluntary on malnutrition should be focused on the knowledge of the early signs of malnutrition, consequences and also prevention. This awareness can be performed in several ways, through posters, radio broadcasts etc.

Awareness about malnutrition should also include awareness about the program, how it works, admission criteria, explaining the phenomenon of rejection, the advantage of management of SAM cases in the program compared to traditional treatment etc.

**Include community leaders on sensitization of CMAM program activities**
The community leaders as village chief, religious leaders should be involved in sensitization of the program to facilitate the acceptance of program by community. It is also important to educate traditional healer in CMAM activities so they can participate in referring cases. Husbands, chiefs and families are also key persons to be involved in this awareness to facilitate greater ownership of the program by households


#### Active case finding by volunteers (monthly)


#### To ensure that each village has a volunteers with a MUAC tape
For each LGA with CMAM activities, it is important to ensure that each village has a volunteer who performs screening activities at least once by month and each volunteer should have a MUAC tape.

  * Perform regular refresher training for volunteers, consider incentives.

  * For the volunteers, it is important to conduct regular refresher training as an incentive


### Service delivery

  * Strengthen integration of CMAM program in routine activities of Health center. In other activities of the Health Centre (consultations, immunization activities, etc.) it would be important to integrate the screening cases MAS
  
  * Harmonize  visit of mothers with many  constraints with schedule of CMAM program. For mothers who have many constraints it is important to discuss with them to harmonize a specific program of visits to the health center.
  
  * Avoid stock out of RUTF of each program


### Access issues
Organize mobile treatment to far villages and give RUTF for two weeks for people who live far from the health center


### Implement the program treatment of moderate acute malnutrition
In the active case finding of the SLEAC survey, several cases of moderate acute malnutrition have been identified and it is essential and important to set up a program of support for moderate acute malnutrition to prevent relapse of severe acute malnutrition after being discharged


### Conduct SQUEAC investigations
Perform SQUEAC investigations at least one by state in order to understand different barriers and boosters and provide strong and evidence-based recommendations for the program
