<p>Empowering New Generations to Improve Nutrition and Economic Opportunities, commonly known as ENGINE, supports the Government of Ethiopia’s efforts to improve the nutritional status of women and young children.  The ENGINE program provides nutrition and health services to 3.1 million children under the age of five, half a million pregnant and lactating women and 3.2 million women of reproductive age in 100 woredas in the Amhara, Tigray, Oromia, and SNNP regions.  The ENGINE program also provides nutrition services to 2.7 million households participating in agricultural and livelihood programs sponsored by USAID.  In addition, ENGINE provides nutrition and health services for women and children in the rural areas who are infected and affected by HIV/AIDS through partial funding provided by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The ENGINE program is designed to break the cycle of malnutrition, an underlying factor for more than fifty percent of all child deaths in Ethiopia, resulting mainly from the poor nutritional status of women before and during pregnancy.</p>
<p>USAID’s lead partner, Save the Children, is implementing ENGINE in cooperation with the Feinstein International Center and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, Jhpiego, Johns Hopkins University Center for Communications Programs, Land O’ Lakes Inc., and Valid International.</p>
